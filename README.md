# NoahSimpleEncryptor
Noah's simple encryptor/decryptor.

This is a tool that encrypts or decrypts files within bin/testingdir. A custom key can also be provided for encoding & decoding.

This project is experimental. Use it at your own risk. Also, the encryption is probably easy to break since it just shifts the values of the characters.
